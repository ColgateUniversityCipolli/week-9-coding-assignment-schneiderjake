In lecture 16, we looked at precipitation amounts in Madison County (at 
Morrisville station). We found that the Weibull distribution had a good fit
to the monthly precipitation amounts.\\

We found that the MLEs for the Weibull distribution were 
\begin{align*}
    \hat{a}&=2.1871\\
    \hat{\sigma}&=3.9683
\end{align*}
and
\[-\mathcal{L}(\{\hat{a}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x}) = 2166.496\]
is the realized negative log-likelihood.
Note this means that the log-likelihood is
\[\mathcal{L}(\{\hat{a}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x}) = -2166.496,\]
and the usual likelihood is
\[L(\{\hat{a}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x}) = e^{\left[\mathcal{L}(\{\hat{a}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x})\right]} \approx = e^{-2166.496},\]
which \texttt{R} cannot differentiate from 0.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Someone asked ``why Weibull?" in class. That is, why wouldn't we use 
  another right-skewed distribution like the Gamma (see Lecture 15), or
  the Log-Normal (see Lecture 17).
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute the MLEs for these data using a Gamma distribution. 
    $\alpha$=4.174581   
    $\beta$=1.189099
  
    \item Compute the MLEs for these data using the Log-Normal distribution.
    $\mu$=1.1312609  
    $\sigma$=0.5333417
    
    \item Compute the likelihood ratio to compare the Weibull and the Gamma distribution. 
    Which has a better fit according to the likelhiood ratio?
    \[Q = \frac{L(\{\hat{a}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x})}{L(\{\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}\}|\mathbf{x})}=e^{\left[\mathcal{L}(\{\hat{a}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x}) - \mathcal{L}(\{\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}\}|\mathbf{x})\right]}= 2.162312e-7\]
    Because our likelihood ratio is less than 1 that means that our Gamma distribution would have a better fit than the Weibull.
    
    \item Compute the likelihood ratio to compare the Weibull and the Log-Normal distribution.
    Which has a better fit according to the likelihood ratio?
    \[Q = \frac{L(\{\hat{a}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x})}{L(\{\hat{\mu}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x})}=e^{\left[\mathcal{L}(\{\hat{a}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x}) - \mathcal{L}(\{\hat{\mu}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x})\right]}=2.371758e+16\]
    Because our likelihood ratio is greater than 1 that means that our Weibull distribution would have a better fit than the Log-Normal.
  
    
    \item Compute the likelihood ratio to compare the Gamma and the Log-Normal distribution.
    Which has a better fit according to the likelhiood ratio?
    \[Q = \frac{L(\{\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}\}|\mathbf{x})}{L(\{\hat{\mu}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x})}=e^{\left[\mathcal{L}(\{\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}\}|\mathbf{x}) - \mathcal{L}(\{\hat{\mu}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x})\right]}=1.096862e+23\]
    Because our likelihood ratio is greater than 1 that means that our Gamma distribution would have a better fit than the Log-Normal.
    
  This means that overall, our Gamma Distribution would fit our data the best. I also fit our distributions to a histogram of our data in Figure \ref{plot1}, which allows us to visually confirm that the Gamma is the best fitting distribution.

  \item Optional Coding Challenge. Choose the ``best" distribution and refit the
  model by season.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Fit the Distribution for Winter (December-February).
    \item Fit the Distribution for Spring (March-May).
    \item Fit the Distribution for Summer (June-August).
    \item Fit the Distribution for Fall (September-November).
    \item Plot the four distributions in one plot using \texttt{cyan3} for Winter,
    \texttt{chartreuse3} for Spring, \texttt{red3} for Summer, and \texttt{chocolate3}
    for Fall. Note any similarities/differences you observe across the seasons.
